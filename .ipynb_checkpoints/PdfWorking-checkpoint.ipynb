      "ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n",
      "\n",
      "DR. JACK PURDUM  started his programming career on an IBM 360 mainframe \n",
      "as a graduate student in the 1960s. In the mid-1970s, he became interested \n",
      "in software development for microcomputers, and he founded his own soft-\n",
      "ware development company (Ecosoft, Inc.) in 1977. The company’s main \n",
      "product was a statistics package (Microstat) that he wanted to rewrite in a \n",
      "new language called C. Lacking a suitable C compiler, Dr. Purdum’s company \n",
      "developed its own MS-DOS-based C compiler and other programming tools. \n",
      "He has been involved with language instruction ever since. Dr. Purdum has \n",
      "\n",
      "authored 17 texts and numerous programming articles and has received several teaching awards. He \n",
      "retired from Purdue University’s College of Technology and is currently involved with on-site train-\n",
      "ing and embedded systems programming.\n",

      "OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS I’VE WRITTEN 18 BOOKS  on various programming topics. You might won-\n",
      "der, why so many…? Didn’t I get it right the ﬁ rst time? Well, no, I didn’t…not really. When I wrote \n",
      "my ﬁ rst book more than 30 years ago, object-oriented programming (OOP) was obscure at best \n",
      "and unknown to most. Like so many others, I had to go through the OOP learning process before \n",
      "I could appreciate what OOP was all about. I have a feeling that there are a lot of people out there \n",
      "who still feel that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time I teach a programming class, I learn new and better ways to explain things. When I look \n",
      "out across a classroom ﬁ lled with students and it looks like a still-life painting, it’s time to back off, \n",
      "retool, and try a different approach to whatever concept it is I’m trying to teach. Every class I’ve \n",
      "taught has offered new perspectives on how I teach and how students learn. I’ve had the opportunity \n",
      "to teach both in a university setting and on site at various companies both here and in Europe. Each \n",
      "experience presented different teaching challenges. Changing my examples and the techniques I use \n",
      "to teach programming concepts is one of the reasons I came back to teaching after so many years \n",
      "away…. I missed the learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of the books I wrote were concerned with languages other than C#, but that too provides \n",
      "for an enriching experience for me as an instructor. The strengths and weaknesses of a language can \n",
      "be appreciated only if you’ve grappled with some other less-than-perfect languages. The fact that \n",
      "programming languages continue to evolve supports the conclusion that I’m not the only one who \n",
      "is still learning. After all this time, the one thing that I have learned with absolute certainty is that \n",
      "whatever I know today will likely be out of date tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the question you should ask yourself is, “Why should I buy this book instead of someone \n",
      "else’s book?” A number of factors come into play, but only one actually makes a difference: This \n",
      "book provides the techniques, examples, and approach to teaching the various programming con-\n",
      "cepts I’ve honed through working with literally thousands of students. I’ve learned what works and \n",
      "what doesn’t. So many authors today are, no doubt, brilliant coders, but they haven’t had to stumble \n",
      "through the bad examples and teaching methods that simply don’t work. Writing good code does \n",
      "not necessarily equate to writing good books.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you will ﬁ nd this book informative, clear in its examples, and perhaps even entertaining in \n",
      "its narrative. I hope you’ll give it a chance…. I think you’ll enjoy the book. Even more important, \n",
      "however, is that you will come to appreciate all that object-oriented programming and C# can do \n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR\n",
      "\n",
      "The book assumes no prior programming experience. That does not mean, however, that the book \n",
      "is “dumbed down” in any way. I build slowly, placing you on solid ground before the next topic is \n",
      "introduced. I encourage you to write your own programs and do the exercises at the end of each \n",
      "chapter. If you try to take shortcuts, you’re actually shortchanging yourself. You should type in \n",
      "every line of code in this book and experiment with it. Do so and you will pick up the language \n",
      "twice as fast and with greater understanding than if you don’t do the examples. (You can download \n",
      "the code from the Wrox website. Details are provided later.) You can learn programming only by \n",
      "writing programs and I encourage you to do so at every possible opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have some programming experience, that’s ﬁ ne, too. This book will likely be an easy read for \n",
      "you. However, you will learn some things along the way. If you have never programmed before…\n",
      "perfect! You don’t have the bad programming baggage so many bring to the experience when they \n",
      "learn a new language.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the perfect book for someone who knows a programming language but learned that lan-\n",
      "guage before object-oriented programming techniques came into existence. There are a lot of \n",
      "“old-timers” like myself who would like to retrain themselves in OOP techniques and gain a full \n",
      "appreciation of what OOP brings to the table. This book suits that need perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike other books, I don’t recommend skipping chapters if you already know a programming \n",
      "language or have some other prior programming experience. If you’re familiar with symbol tables, \n",
      "lvalues, and rvalues, and the Bucket Analogy, good—but it won’t hurt you to read about them again \n",
      "from a different perspective. No shortcuts, remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT THIS BOOK COVERS\n",
      "\n",
      "This text begins with a nonprogramming-language introduction to object-oriented programming. \n",
      "The goal of that chapter is to present the concept of objects ﬁ rst and then ease into how objects \n",
      "may be viewed in C#. Virtually all of the concepts presented in this book are portable to other lan-\n",
      "guages. The program design skills, coding style and techniques, and debugging methods are applica-\n",
      "ble to almost any programming language. C# and Visual Studio are simply the vehicle for teaching \n",
      "these skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the book common, easily understood examples introduce new programming concepts. \n",
      "Most of the C# programming language is covered; although, there are a few less-common topics not \n",
      "covered. These omissions aren’t important to the task at hand, which is to teach you OOP using C#. \n",
      "When you have completed this book, you should feel comfortable designing, writing, testing, and \n",
      "debugging complex OOP programs of your own design.\n",

      "HOW THIS BOOK IS STRUCTURED\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequencing of the chapters was dictated by what I use when I taught this class to freshmen stu-\n",
      "dents. The chapter count is no accident and is geared to a college programming course of one semes-\n",
      "ter in length. If you use the book as a self-study guide, great, but don’t feel that you need to speed \n",
      "through the book. Understand each chapter before moving onto the next. Take the time to let things \n",
      "“sink in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequence makes logical sense, and each chapter builds upon the information contained in the \n",
      "previous chapters. Although you could skip around, this would detract from the learning experi-\n",
      "ence. I have my own way to explain things and some are unusual…but they work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each chapter has several questions and exercises at the end of it. You are encouraged to work \n",
      "through those examples before you progress to the next chapter. As said previously, you can learn \n",
      "programming only by writing programs. It’s easy to get lulled into a false sense of security by read-\n",
      "ing code and saying, “Yeah, I got that.” Perhaps…perhaps not. Writing your own programs is the \n",
      "only way to know for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT YOU NEED TO USE THIS BOOK\n",
      "\n",
      "All the examples in this book were written using Visual Studio 2012 and C#. As I write this mate-\n",
      "rial, C# Express is available only for Windows 8. However, Visual Studio Professional is available \n",
      "for other versions of Windows. Although Visual Studio Professional has a limited trial period, that \n",
      "time slice is more than long enough to work through this book. By the time you ﬁ nish this book, \n",
      "you will likely want to purchase Visual Studio, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions in Chapter 1, “Introducing C#,” tell you how to download and install Visual \n",
      "Studio Professional and C# from Microsoft at no charge. If you use Windows 8, you may want to \n",
      "download the Express version of Visual Studio. It is an incredible piece of software and has most \n",
      "of the functionality of the full Visual Studio. There are some nice tools missing from the Express \n",
      "edition, but there is enough there for you to experience most of what Visual Studio and C# have \n",
      "to offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should use a Pentium-based system (although emulators also exist for the Mac and Linux, \n",
      "and they appear to work well) with at least 4G of memory and 11G of disk space. As mentioned, \n",
      "the version of Windows you use may affect which ﬂ avor of Visual Studio you want to download. \n",
      "The examples in this book work with either the Professional or Express versions of C#. After those \n",
      "requirements, the system you use is a matter of taste.\n",

      "PROGRAMMING (OOP)\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people believe that OOP is a product of the 1980s and the work done by Bjarne Stroustrup \n",
      "in moving the C language into the object-oriented world by creating the C++ language. Actually, \n",
      "SIMULA 1 (1962) and Simula 67 (1967) are the two earliest object-oriented languages. The work \n",
      "on the Simula languages was done by Ole-John Dahl and Kristen Nygaard at the Norwegian \n",
      "Computing Center in Oslo, Norway. Although most of the advantages of OOP were available in the \n",
      "earlier Simula languages, it wasn’t until C++ became entrenched in the 1990s that OOP began to \n",
      "ﬂ ourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "C was the parent language of C++ and it was often said that C was powerful enough to shoot \n",
      "yourself in the foot multiple times. C++, on the other hand, not only was powerful enough to \n",
      "shoot yourself in the foot, but also you could blow your entire leg off without too much difﬁ culty. \n",
      "Most programmers admit that C++ is a powerful language and it is still in widespread use today. \n",
      "However, with that power comes a lot of complexity. Language developers wanted a simpler and \n",
      "perhaps less complex language for OOP development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step in the development of OOP started in January 1991 when James Gosling, Bill Joy, \n",
      "Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheradin, and several others met in Aspen, Colorado, to discuss ideas for \n",
      "the Stealth Project. The group wanted to develop intelligent electronic devices capable of being cen-\n",
      "trally controlled and programmed from a handheld device. They decided that OOP was the right \n",
      "direction to go with the development language but felt that C++ was not up to the job. The result \n",
      "was the Oak programming language (named after an oak tree outside Gosling’s window), which \n",
      "eventually morphed into the Java programming language. (Oak had to be renamed because the team \n",
      "discovered that a language by that name already existed.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Java quickly grew in popularity, spurred by the growth of the World Wide Web. In both cases this \n",

      "To many programmers, C# is Microsoft’s answer to Java. Some would even say that C# is the result \n",
      "of Microsoft’s stubbornness to refuse to promote a language it did not develop. That sentiment is \n",
      "a bit too harsh. Microsoft had good reasons for developing C#, not the least of which was that it \n",
      "wanted type-safe programs that run in a managed environment. You may not appreciate exactly \n",
      "what that means right now, but it will become clear as you learn C#.\n",

      "\n",
      "You could immediately proceed to the next chapter and start reading. Not a good idea. Now that \n",

      "ple, your program doesn’t have any text in the program’s title bar. Surely C# provides a property \n",
      "that enables you to change the title bar. (Hint: It does provide such a property!) Play around with \n",
      "some of the other properties to see what they do. For example, change the foreground property and \n",
      "see what happens. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward, at the end of each chapter in this book are set of exercises that you should do \n",
      "before reading the subsequent chapter. You will probably be eager to move to the next chapter, \n",
      "but resist the temptation to skip the exercises—be sure to do them. They can help crystallize what \n",
      "you’ve learned in the current chapter and better prepare you for the content of the next chapter. You \n",
      "can ﬁ nd the solutions to all the exercises in Appendix A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programming should be fun, and some of that fun comes from discovering what happens if you \n",
      "change this to that. If you see smoke coming out of your computer, don’t make that change again. \n",
      "(Just kidding…you can’t hurt your computer if you make an incorrect change to a property.) \n",

      "these activities are lumped under the Initialization step.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 2: Input\n",
      "If you think about it, all programs take some kind of input into the program, process it in some way, \n",
      "and then display some variation of the data that was derived from the original inputs. The Input \n",
      "step, therefore, is concerned with getting those inputs into the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time you tend to think of program input as coming from the keyboard or mouse. \n",
      "However, input can come from many other input sources, too. Some examples are an engine sensor, \n",

      "data in some form is collected by the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s always a good practice to validate the input data. Users do make mistakes when entering data, \n",
      "network connections sometimes do weird things, data sources can be locked, and other unexpected \n",
      "occurrences can corrupt the data. You will learn more about data validation in later chapters. For \n",

      "Step 3: Process\n",
      "This is the step in which you take the program inputs and process them in some way. You might \n",
      "perform some kind of mathematical operation on them, or perhaps the inputs are the name and \n",
      "account number of a customer, and this step reads a database to calculate a bill to be sent to the \n",

      "when the plane will touch down at a speciﬁ c airport. In all cases, the Process step involves taking \n",

      "\n",
      "What is meant by “taking the inputs and acting upon them”? That sentence fragment should make \n",
      "something itch in the back of your mind. What do you call those thingies that take an object's data \n",
      "and act upon them? Right...methods! Quite often, therefore, the Process step uses class methods to \n",

      "(perhaps at 1 a.m. when no one else is using the system), read the input information from some input \n",

      "the contents that have been typed into the various textboxes by the user. To make the program \n",
      "code smarter, you should add code to verify that something was typed into the textbox and that \n",
      "the data is appropriate for the information wanted. For example, if you want to validate the \n",
      "content of the Text property for the ZIP code textbox object, perhaps you should check to see if \n",

      "you should check to make sure exactly six characters were entered. This way you could allow \n",
      "Canadian postal codes, too, because those codes use both alpha and digit characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second improvement would make the output a little easier to read. If you look closely at the \n",
      "output in Figure 2-16, you can notice that the ﬁ elds don’t line up properly. This is true even \n",

      "by using an appropriate number of spaces before each ﬁ eld. Why didn’t this work?\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason is that label objects have their default Font property set to the Microsoft Sans \n",
      "Serif font. This is what is called a TrueType font. A TrueType font is a variable-spaced font. \n",
      "What that means is that each character in a TrueType variable font takes up only as much \n",

      "less space on the screen than does the letter W. Therefore, because different letters take up \n",

      "such as ﬁ nding a square root, a sine, or a cosine of a numeric quantity, and so on. You will also \n",

      "may assume the value of on (1) or off (0). This means that the most basic unit of information \n",
      "in a computer—the bit—has only two possible states: on and off. Because there are only two \n",
      "possible states, information is stored in a computer in a binary, or base-2, format. Although \n",
      "you perform mathematical operations using a base-10 numbering system, the computer prefers \n",
      "base-2 numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "From an engineering standpoint, it is more convenient to group the bits into a larger unit called a \n",
      "byte. A byte is a collection of 8 bits. Because each bit has two possible values, a byte can have 28, or \n",
      "256, unique combinations. If you refer to Table 3-1, you can see that a byte data type can represent \n",

      "Referring to Table 3-2, you can see the numeric value of a byte depends upon which bits are turned \n",

      "Signed Integer Values\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this information, why is the sbyte data type limited to a maximum value of 128? The reason \n",
      "is that the sbyte data type is a signed byte. Because it is signed, sbyte data may assume positive or \n",
      "negative values. The highest bit of the byte (bit position 7) is used to store the sign of the number. \n",
      "For signed numbers, the high bit is called the sign bit. If the sign bit is turned on, it is a negative \n",
      "number. If the sign bit is turned off, it is a positive number. Because of the sign bit, only seven bits \n",
      "(27 combinations) are available instead of eight bits (28combinations). Because 27 is 128, only 128 \n",
      "unique values are possible, and because 0 is one of those values, the maximum positive value is 127.\n",
      "If the sign bit is turned on, you still have 128 unique values available, all of which can be negative. \n",
      "This is true because you have already accounted for the value 0 in the positive range of values. This \n",
      "means the negative range extends from –1 to –128. Referring to Table 3-1, you can see that if the \n",
      "range of permissible values begins with 0, that integer data type does not use a sign bit. If the range \n",
      "includes negative values, it does use a sign bit. You can also see that integer data types that do use a \n",
      "sign bit have a maximum value that is approximately one-half that of their corresponding unsigned \n",
      "data types. The reason, of course, is that the highest bit is reserved for the sign of the number.\n",

      "One problem beginning programmers face is deciding which integer data type to use. There is no \n",

      " ‰ Range of values: If you are interested only in counting the number of healthy teeth in a per-\n",
      "\n",
      "son’s mouth, the byte data type works. On the other hand, if you measure the day’s high \n",

      "Death Valley and Juneau, Alaska. Always err on the high side so that you have sufﬁ cient \n",
      "range to accommodate your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      " ‰ Memory limitations: For most of the applications you write, you probably have at least half \n",

      "a gigabyte of memory available to you. If you select a long data type instead of an int,\n",
      "chances are the 4 extra bytes used per integer value aren’t going to gobble up much addi-\n",

      "Which Floating-Point Data Type Should You Use?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's probably obvious from Table 3-4 that the increased precision for a double is possible because C# \n",
      "uses twice as much memory to store a double as a float. This invites the question…again, “Which \n",
      "ﬂ oating-point data type should you use?” Once again, the answer is, “It depends.” The same factors \n",
      "that inﬂ uence your choice of integer data types (memory limitations, processor and library consid-\n",
      "erations, convention, and so on) play a part to make the right data type choice. The processor and \n",
      "library considerations, however, are especially important when you deal with ﬂ oating-point data.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Intel’s Pentium-class CPU has a math coprocessor built into it. The math coprocessor is \n",
      "speciﬁ cally designed to make ﬂ oating-point math operations as fast as possible. Using the math copro-\n",
      "cessor involves no special coding work on your part. Floating-point data is automatically routed to the \n",
      "math coprocessor when your program performs math operations on ﬂ oating-point data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, almost all the methods in the Math class (Sqrt(), Pow(), Log(), Cos(), and so on) expect \n",
      "to use the double data type. Again, if you pass a float data type to the Sqrt() method of the \n",
      "Math class, code must be executed to expand the data value from 32 bits to 64 bits. The process to \n",
      "expand a data value from a smaller to a larger number of bits is called data widening. After Sqrt()\n",
      "has done its job, code must be executed to shrink the result back to the 32 bits your float data type \n",
      "demands. The process to shrink a data value from a larger to smaller number of bits is called data \n",
      "narrowing. The code associated with data narrowing and data widening can be avoided if you use a \n",
      "double data type when using the methods found in the Math class.\n",
      "\n",

      "age requirements. For example, a byte data type requires 1 byte of storage but a long data type \n",
      "requires 8 bytes of storage. However, if you simply wanted to store the value 1 in a long, you \n",
      "still need to use 8 bytes of storage even though a single byte could store that value. For value data \n",
      "types, the number of bytes required to hold the rvalue is etched in stone for each one. Although \n",
      "using a ﬁ xed number of bytes for value types works ﬁ ne, it won’t work for things like string data. \n",
      "After all, the string might be used to hold a name like Hailey, but some other string variable in \n",
      "the program might be used to store the Declaration of Independence. Clearly, reference data types \n",

      "you want to use in a program. Second, because the rvalue of a reference can hold only null or a \n",
      "memory address, the size of a reference variable is always 4 bytes on 32 bit systems. This means that \n",
      "the size of a reference variable’s bucket is always the same regardless of the actual data that might \n",

      "Visual Studio know which one to call? Visual Studio makes the decision based upon the signature of \n",
      "the method.\n",
      "\n",
      "A method signature is everything from the method name through the closing parenthesis of the \n",
      "method. For example, you already know that the DateTime() constructor method has 12 different \n",
      "forms. You have seen 2 of these. The 2 forms you have used are these:\n",
      "\n",
      "public DateTime()\n",
      "public DateTime(int year, int month, int day)\n",
      "\n",
      "The signature for the ﬁ rst constructor is DateTime(). The signature for the second is DateTime(int\n",
      "year, int month, int day). The signatures are different because the parameter lists for the two \n",
      "methods are different. That is, the ﬁ rst version of the constructor does not have any arguments \n",
      "passed to it. The second signature, however, expects three integer arguments to be passed to it. \n",
      "Therefore, the three statements from Listing 5-2 are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "        DateTime myTime = new DateTime();\n",
      "        myTime = DateTime.Now;\n",

      "overloaded provided no two overloaded methods have the same signature. What this means is that \n",
      "only one overloaded method can have zero arguments passed to it. Likewise, only one overloaded \n",
      "method can have three integers passed to it. An overloaded method can have three other variables \n",
      "passed to it, but they cannot all be integers. For example, you could have an overloaded method \n",

      "public int countThis(int val);\n",
      "public int countThis(long val);\n",

      "The code that does all the work is found in the button click event method (refer to Listing 6-1).\n",
      "\n",
      "The btnCalc_Click() method begins by deﬁ ning several working variables. Note how you initial-\n",
      "ized the string variable named output with the string literal Number is even. You then used the \n",
      "TryParse() method to convert the text entered by the user into a numeric value.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the TryParse( ) Method Works\n",
      "\n",
      "You have brieﬂ y studied the TryParse()method in earlier chapters. However, because it is such a use-\n",
      "ful method, a more complete discussion using some of the terms you learned in the last chapter is pre-\n",
      "sented here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The TryParse() method is normally used to convert data from a string format to a numeric format. In \n",
      "this example, the TryParse() method is part of the int object type, as shown by the int.TryParse()\n",
      "method call in Listing 6-1. The TryParse() method requires two arguments: 1) the string to be con-\n",
      "verted, and 2) the variable that will hold the numeric value if the data conversion is successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The keyword out in the second argument is necessary and must precede the numeric variable name. \n",
      "The data type of the variable (such as val) must match the ﬂ avor of TryParse() you use (such as int\n",
      ".TryParse() in this example). You can think of the out keyword as serving two purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the out keyword tells C# that it’s okay to use this variable even though it has not been initialized \n",
      "to any known value. (You should always assume that an uninitialized C# variable contains random \n",
      "junk. You will write better code making this assumption.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the out keyword also tells C# that it is the lvalue being passed to the method, not the \n",
      "rvalue. Recall that, by default, arguments are passed by making a copy of the rvalue of the data \n",
      "item. With TryParse(), it is the lvalue that gets passed. Using the Bucket Analogy, this means that \n",
      "the TryParse() method knows where the bucket for val is located in memory. Because this ﬂ avor \n",
      "of TryParse() is a method for the int object type, it also knows the size of the bucket. Given that \n",
      "TryPrase() knows where the data resides in memory and its type, TryPrase() has everything it needs \n",
      "to permanently change the value of the variable being passed to it in its second argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "TryParse() takes the string of characters from the ﬁ rst argument and tries to format those characters \n",
      "into a numeric data value. If one of the characters is inconsistent with a numeric digit character, the \n",

      "often what starts out as a single statement in the if statement block ends up with multiple state-\n",

      "even when the if statement block only contains one statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another style consideration is where to place the curly braces. For example, because C# doesn’t care \n",

      "and Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s (The C Programming Language, Prentice Hall, 1978). One reason \n",

      "Failure to initialize a loop variable almost always means that the loop executes an unexpected num-\n",

      "\n",
      "The second condition means that you must have some form of test that decides whether another pass \n",

      "ﬁ rst condition against some termination criteria. This condition often means that a relational opera-\n",
      "tor is part of the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third condition means that some variable must change its value during the execution of the \n",
      "loop. If the state of the loop does not change during execution, there is no condition that can termi-\n",
      "nate the loop. This produces an inﬁ nite loop, which is one that continues to execute forever. Most of \n",

      "\n",
      "i = i + 1;\n",

      "\n",
      "i = i – 1;\n",
      "\n",
      "The post-decrement operator, therefore, takes the current value of variable i and subtracts 1 from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a increment or decrement operator “stands by itself” as it does in the for loop, only the single \n",
      "variable is affected. Now consider the following statement:\n",
      "\n",
      "k = i++;\n",
      "\n",
      "If the value of i just before this statement is 5, what’s the value of k? Is k equal to 5 or 6? In other \n",
      "words, at what point does the increment take place? In this example, because you use the post-incre-\n",
      "ment operator, the value of k is 5, but the value of i when the statement ﬁ nishes executing is 6. This \n",
      "is why it is called a post-increment operator. You use the value ﬁ rst (using the assignment operator \n",
      "in this example) and then you perform the increment operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you probably suspected, there is also a pre-increment operator. A pre-increment operation places \n",
      "the two plus signs before the variable name. With pre-increment operations, the increment is per-\n",
      "formed before the value is used. Therefore, if i is 5 before the following statement:\n",
      "\n",
      "k = ++i;\n",
      "\n",
      "the value of k is 6, as is the value of i.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "k = i--;\n",
      "\n",
      "the value of k is 5, but the value of i is 4. Again, the reasoning is the same: The decrement operation \n",

      "\n",
      "k = --i;\n",

      "You will discover hundreds of situations in which the for loop offers the perfect way to solve a \n",

      "used most often. A bonus feature of the for loop is that all three requirements for a well-behaved \n",
      "loop are speciﬁ ed in the three expressions used in a for statement. Having all three requirements for \n",
      "a well-behaved loop in one place makes it difﬁ cult to forget any of them.\n",

      "The square of a number N is equal to the sum of N positive odd integers, starting with 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reread the algorithm again and think about it. For example, suppose you want to ﬁ nd the square of \n",

      "N2 = 1 + 3 + 5\n",

      "WHAT IS AN ARRAY?\n",
      "\n",
      "An array is a group of identical data types that share a common name. The syntax to deﬁ ne an \n",
      "array is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "typeSpecifier[] arrayName = new typeSpecifier[numberOfElements];\n",
      "\n",
      "where:\n",
      "\n",
      " ‰ typeSpecifier is the data type you want to use.\n",
      " ‰ arrayName is the name you want to use for the array.\n",
      " ‰ numberOfElements is the number of array elements you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these parts is explained in a moment using the following example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you have an address book with 100 names in it. Because you want to manipulate those \n",
      "names in some way in your program, each unique name must be stored in a unique variable. \n",
      "Because names are textual data, you could use something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "string name00;\n",
      "string name01;\n",
      "string name02;\n",
      "string name03;\n",
      "//...Many more variables...\n",
      "string name98;\n",
      "string name99;\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this would work, it suffers two serious drawbacks. First, you would get tired of typing in \n",
      "all those variable names. Even worse, think what would happen if the address book had a million \n",
      "names in it! Second, how would you perform the common task to search the names in the list for a \n",
      "speciﬁ c person? You’d be forced to plow through 100 if statements looking for a particular name:\n",
      "\n",
      "if (name00.Equals(targetName))\n",
      "{\n",
      "         index = 0;\n",
      "}\n",
      "else\n",
      "{\n",
      "     if (name01.Equals(targetName))\n",
      "     {\n",
      "          index = 1;\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     else   //...and so on...\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that when you compare objects like strings, you don’t compare rvalue-to-rvalue. \n",
      "Instead, you want to compare what is stored at the memory address contained in the object’s rvalue. \n",
      "Therefore, when comparing strings, you should use the Equals ()method, which is available for \n",
      "all string objects. Such a programming solution is not practical, which is precisely why arrays were \n",
      "created.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of using 100 different variables, one for each name, you would deﬁ ne a single string array to \n",

      "The program now has a string array variable named names that can store 100 names. You can use \n",
      "what you learned about loops in the previous chapter to simplify the code:\n",
      "\n",

      "     }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "If you read the code carefully, you can see that on the ﬁ rst pass through the loop, the if test compares \n",
      "the ﬁ rst name in the list (names[0]) to the name stored in targetName, the name you want to ﬁ nd. If \n",
      "the test fails, the loop counter variable i is incremented by the third expression of the for loop (i++)\n",
      "and the code makes the next comparison test (if names[1].Equals(targetName)). The loop contin-\n",
      "ues until a match is found. At that time, the index is assigned the value of i (so you can reference that \n",
      "person later) and the break statement sends program control to the ﬁ rst statement following the for\n",
      "loop. If no match is found, index is unchanged and the search fails. (Setting index to -1 before entering \n",
      "the loop is a good way to tell if the search failed because -1 cannot be used as an index into an array.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, there is a symbiotic relationship between arrays and loops, and they are used \n",
      "together often to solve a myriad of programming problems. Also note that names.Length is used for \n",
      "the expression2 in the for loop above since it returns the number of elements in the array. This is \n",
      "much preferred to hard coding a value for the number of elements in the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Array Details\n",

      "\n",
      "Array Element Versus Array Index\n",
      "\n",
      "An array element is a single unit of an array. Consider the following array deﬁ nition:\n",
      "\n",
      "int[] myData = new int[10];\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement says that you want 10 integers arranged back to back in memory and that you want \n",
      "to refer to them as myData. You can see how this might look in memory in Figure 8-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of those 10 integers is referred to as one element in the array. When you deﬁ ne the size of the \n",
      "array, you always specify the number of elements you want. That number appears between the last \n",
      "set of brackets at the end of the deﬁ nition statement ([10] in this example).\n",
      "\n",
      "An array index refers to the position of a speciﬁ c element in the array. In the example you requested \n",
      "10 elements, but the position of the ﬁ rst element is index 0. Like almost everything else, C# counts \n",
      "array indexes starting with 0. Therefore, in\n",
      "\n",
      "val = myData[0];\n",
      "\n",
      "val would equal the content of the ﬁ rst element of the myData array. This also means that an index \n",
      "of 0 accesses the ﬁ rst element of the array. (In Figure 8-1, val is assigned the value stored at the 4 \n",

      "program with which the end user interacts. This type of user interface has visual objects presented \n",
      "on a form, such as frmMain has always used. The user then interacts with textbox, button, listbox, \n",

      "The second type of user interface does not require a visual representation. For example, all the prop-\n",
      "erties and methods that have the public access speciﬁ er comprise the user interface for a class. In \n",
      "this case, the user is actually a programmer. The public properties and methods of the class form \n",
      "the API for that class and thus deﬁ ne how the programmer interfaces with it. For these reasons, this \n",

      "\n",
      "CONSTRUCTORS\n",
      "\n",
      "You should think of constructors as methods designed to create, or instantiate, an object. The sole \n",
      "purpose of a constructor is to enable you to instantiate an object with a known state. The beauty of \n",
      "C# (and most other OOP languages) is that you get a default constructor automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Default Constructors\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the creation of a default constructor possible, a constructor always has the same name as \n",
      "its class. For example, if you want to create an object named myDate of the clsDates class, you \n",
      "would use the following statement:\n",
      "\n",
      "clsDates myDate = new clsDate();\n",
      "\n",
      "You've seen this syntax before, but now dig a little deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, notice that the leftmost reference to clsDates is simply the name of the class: No closing \n",
      "parentheses follow the class name. In effect, this reference to clsDates is simply telling you which \n",
      "cookie cutter to take from the thousands of them hanging on the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the purpose of the identiﬁ er myDate is to enable you to give a name to the reference variable\n",
      "that your code uses as a link to the data for the clsDates class. You learned in Chapter 5 that the \n",
      "rvalue of a reference variable is either null or the memory address of the location of the data for the \n",
      "object. For learning purposes, you can think of myDate as having the rvalue of null at this instant \n",
      "in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the keyword new should always jog your memory and make you remember that there are \n",
      "going to be some messages exchanged between your program and the Windows Memory Manager. \n",
      "Speciﬁ cally, new means that you are asking Windows for enough memory to store a clsDates\n",
      "object. Assuming that enough memory is found, the rvalue of myDate instantly changes from null\n",
      "to the memory address of where the object is stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the ﬁ nal expression in the statement is clsDates(). Note that, unlike the ﬁ rst reference to the \n",
      "class at the beginning of the statement, this reference is followed by parentheses. This means that the \n",
      "code is calling a method. In this case clsDates() is a call to the constructor method. If you don’t \n",
      "write your own constructor, C# still calls its own default class constructor. When the default con-\n",
      "structor ﬁ nishes executing, all the value type data in the class have the value 0, and all the reference \n",
      "variables have the value null. The default constructor places the object in a known state in which \n",
      "value types are 0 and references are null (unless the data is also initialized at its point of deﬁ nition).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nondefault Constructors\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so when do you need to write a nondefault constructor? Under two basic circumstances: \n",
      "1) when your class design is not happy with the default state of the object when it comes to life or \n",
      "2) when a nondefault constructor makes life easier for the programmer who is using your class.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ﬁ rst reason means that there is something about starting out with all the class data set to either \n",
      "0 or null that just isn’t the “right” state for the object. For example, in Chapter 9 the default con-\n",
      "structor was changed to this:\n",

      "\n",
      "You've already studied method overloading in Chapter 5. Because a constructor is nothing more \n",
      "than a method that is always called when an object is instantiated, constructors may also be over-\n",
      "loaded. For example, you can add the following constructor to the code shown in Listing 9-4:\n",
      "\n",
      "    public clsDates(int yr)\n",
      "    {\n",
      "        year = yr;\n",

      "\n",
      "Now you have two constructors. As mentioned in Chapter 5, method overloading is never a prob-\n",
      "lem as long as the method signatures are different. Because this second constructor has an integer \n",
      "parameter (yr) passed to it, the signatures are different. However, you can now use the following \n",
      "statement to instantiate the myDate object:\n",
      "\n",
      "clsDates myDate = new clsDate(year);\n",
      "\n",

      "the “no-code” default constructor no longer exists and you must supply your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as you’ve seen so many times before, the Initialization Step of the Five Program Steps creates the \n",

      "\n",
      "As you’ve learned in this chapter, property methods are used to read and write the values associated \n",
      "with the properties in a class. Because they are public, property methods form an important part of \n",
      "the user interface for the class. However, the purpose of a property method (either getting or setting) \n",
      "is correctly constrained to the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helper and General methods, on the other hand, are designed to use or act upon the properties of \n",
      "the class. Because Helper methods always use the private access speciﬁ er, they do not form part of \n",
      "the user interface (API) for the class. Instead, they reduce the coding burden on you, the program-\n",
      "mer of the class. Helper methods are often used for validation purposes. Checking and validating \n",
      "data, like the format of phone and Social Security numbers, is a task often given to Helper methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "General methods, however, are often used to derive new data from the property data. For example, \n",
      "an inventory class might have a property that records the quantity of an item sold. There might be \n",
      "a General method that takes the quantity sold and multiplies it by a price per item to produce a \n",
      "total purchase amount. A General method for the class might be called getTotalCost(). Another \n",
      "General method named getShippingCost() might use the weight per unit and the quantity sold to \n",
      "calculate the shipping charges. Yet another method named getSalesTaxDue() might calculate the \n",
      "sales tax for the order, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cohesion\n",
      "\n",
      "The important thing to notice about each of these General methods is that each one is geared to a \n",
      "speciﬁ c and narrowly deﬁ ned task. These narrowly deﬁ ned tasks illustrate the concept of cohesion.\n",
      "This term refers to the ability to describe what a method does in one or two sentences. If it takes \n",
      "more than a couple of sentences to deﬁ ne its purpose, chances are it is not a cohesive method. A \n",
      "cohesive method does a single task, and you should be able to describe its purpose crisply and con-\n",
      "cisely. If you can’t, it’s back to the drawing board to rethink the method’s design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning programmers often try to create Swiss Army knives by designing a method that performs \n",
      "multiple tasks. This is usually a bad idea for two reasons. First, methods that attempt to multitask \n",
      "complicate the code. Several simple methods that perform one task each are simpler to write, test, \n",
      "debug, and maintain than one method that tries to multitask. Second, single-task methods have \n",
      "a higher chance of being reused than a complex method that attempts to solve multiple problems \n",
      "at once. The more tasks you try to pack into a single method, the less likely it is that the precise \n",
      "sequence of tasks can be reused in some other program.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s common for programmers to lump bugs, program errors, and program exceptions into a single \n",
      "concept. Technically, each of these types of errors is different. Now consider each in a little more \n",
      "detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bugs\n",
      "\n",
      "A bug is a speciﬁ c type of error caused by the programmer. Bugs typically fall into one of three gen-\n",
      "eral categories:\n",
      "\n",
      " ‰ Syntax errors\n",
      "\n",
      " ‰ Semantic errors\n",
      "\n",
      " ‰ Logic errors\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntax Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "A syntax error occurs when a statement does not comply with the rules of the language. Just as \n",
      "English has speciﬁ c rules, so do programming languages. A sentence in English, for example, is \n",
      "expected to have a noun and a verb. A programming statement is similar to a sentence, and if you \n",
      "don’t obey the rules, syntax errors result. A program that has a syntax error cannot be compiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visual Studio’s IntelliSense does an excellent job of detecting syntax errors the instant you enter a pro-\n",
      "gram statement. The dreaded squiggly line tells you the nature of the syntax error that you’ve made. If \n",
      "you place the cursor over the squiggly line, Visual Studio presents a message informing you of the prob-\n",
      "able cause of the error. When you start writing programs, they probably have a ton of squiggly lines in \n",
      "them. However, as you gain experience with C#, the frequency of your syntax errors likely decreases. If \n",
      "you’re like most programmers, however, you move to bigger, better, and more complex errors!\n",
      "\n",
      "Semantic Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "Semantic errors occur when you use the proper language syntax, but the context of the state-\n",
      "ment or expression is wrong. For example, you could say the following English sentence, “The dog \n",
      "meowed.” The syntax is correct because the sentence has a noun and a verb, but the context of the \n",
      "noun and verb is wrong. A program with a semantic error can often be compiled, but the results are \n",
      "(usually) wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "int j;\n",

      "\n",
      "j = 10;\n",
      "answer = 1 / j;\n",
      "\n",
      "The code generates no error messages from IntelliSense and does compile. However, answer is \n",
      "always 0 for any value of j that is greater than 1. (The code, for example, does produce the correct \n",
      "result if j equals 1.) In this context, you try to create a fractional value using integer math. If you \n",

      "Logic Errors\n",
      "\n",

      "lowed by an opening curly brace. Following the curly brace are the program statements that you \n",
      "think might cause an exception to be generated, or thrown, by the program. (Most programmers \n",
      "would say, “This code might throw an exception.”) A closing curly brace for the try statement \n",

      "try statement block (for example, you might have opened a ﬁ le or database, or maybe a network or \n",

      "\n",
      "Test Data Sets\n",
      "The key to bug detection is test data sets. To create these sets, take a known set of inputs (the Input \n",
      "step) and process that set of inputs by hand (the Process step). (Automated test sets can also be \n",
      "used, but that is beyond the scope of this book.) You then record the data from the Process step, the \n",
      "results of which become the Output step. These hand-generated test results serve as the yardstick by \n",
      "which you measure the output of your program.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you decide what data to test? In other words, how do you select the inputs by which to \n",
      "judge the output produced by the computer? First, select a “typical” data set that a user might be \n",
      "expected to use. For example, if you write a program that ﬁ gures out the sales tax to apply to a pur-\n",
      "chase, you might test the method by supplying a purchase of 10 units at a price of $100 each to see if \n",
      "the computer produces the same sales tax ﬁ gure as your hand-generated calculations. Such “typical” \n",
      "test data sets produce “typical” results. However, typical data rarely exercise those places where the \n",
      "bugs lurk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Program bugs love to hide in what I call boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are those that \n",
      "lie at the extremes of the test data set. In the sales tax example, one test of a boundary condition \n",
      "is to determine what your method does if the sales tax rate is zero. Another boundary condition is \n",
      "when the quantity purchased is zero or the price is zero. Even if your sales tax method does properly \n",
      "handle a zero sales tax boundary condition, do subsequent methods called after this boundary con-\n",

      "cially when some purchases are exempt from sales tax. For example, some states exempt educational \n",
      "institutions from sales taxes, whereas other states exempt certain products (such as food).\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, you should enter extremely large values that exercise the upper-boundary conditions of a \n",
      "test data set. A minimum test data set should target the smallest expected value (zero), some typical \n",
      "value(s), and the largest expected value. One upper-limit test is to have input values that run at or \n",
      "near the range limit for the data type being used in the test. For example, if byte data sets are used, \n",
      "try running an upper-limit test using an input value of 255. Likewise, if textboxes are expecting \n",
      "numeric data to be entered, what does the program do if the user types in her ﬁ rst name? Good pro-\n",

      "\n",

      "erly processes its data. Whenever possible, make sure you include test data sets that exercise the \n",
      "program’s boundary conditions as well as more typical values. If your program uses arrays, exercise \n",
      "data sets for the lowest and highest index values allowed for the arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your test data must exercise every code path. This means that programs with if-else code paths \n",

      "bad news is that it’s easy to get the code wrong, especially when determining that you’ve hit the \n",

      "\n",
      "clsSort mySort = new clsSort(data);\n",
      "\n",
      "As you saw, the problem is that the algorithm is based upon using an int data type for the process-\n",

      "\n",
      "clsSort<T> mySort = new clsSort<T>(data);\n",
      "\n",
      "The data type you want to use is substituted for the term T within the enclosing angle brackets. For \n",
      "example, if you want to sort the int data values stored in the data array, you would use this code:\n",
      "\n",
      "clsSort<int> mySort = new clsSort<int>(data);\n",
      "\n",
      "In some later project that uses the double data type, you would use this code:\n",
      "\n",
      "clsSort<double> mySort = new clsSort<double>(data);\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key advantages of generics is that the same code can process different data types without\n",
      "the source code being changed for each data type! If you write a class using the generic model, that \n",

      "You might be saying, “Wait a minute! Can’t ArrayLists do the same thing? After all, they come \n",

      "save that information permanently on disk, it means moving the strings from memory to a disk data \n",
      "ﬁ le. If the user types a number into a textbox and that number is used numerically (for example, if \n",
      "the square root of that number is taken), the number is stored in memory in a binary format. For \n",

      "One of the nice things about text ﬁ les is that it is easy to read the content of a text ﬁ le. You can use a \n",
      "simple program like Notepad (which comes free with Windows) to read a text ﬁ le. Because text ﬁ les \n",

      "Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Access Files\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest advantage of random access ﬁ les is that you can get to a particular record much faster \n",
      "than you can with sequential ﬁ les. It’s common to tie a customer’s record location in the ﬁ le to some \n",
      "unique piece of information associated with the customer. For example, imagine a customer’s last \n",
      "name is Smith. The ASCII code for the letter S is 83. Therefore, you could write this customer at \n",
      "record position 83 in the ﬁ le. If each record is 300 bytes, this person’s information would be stored \n",
      "at byte offset 24,900 bytes relative to the BOF. The process to use one piece of information (an S) to \n",
      "derive a second piece of information (record 83) is called hashing. Using a hash code algorithm for \n",
      "record positions within a random access ﬁ le makes locating an individual record fast. Obviously, if a \n",
      "second Smith is added to the ﬁ le, this creates a hash collision, and the hash algorithm must accom-\n",
      "modate such things. (If you’re interested, C# provides a HashAlgorithm class that you can use in \n",
      "your own programs. Use the online help for further details.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only are random access ﬁ les better at ﬁ nding a speciﬁ c piece of information, random access ﬁ les \n",
      "can update that information faster, too. Because each record in a random access ﬁ le is exactly the \n",
      "same size, you can easily update a particular record and rewrite that record without needing to copy \n",
      "the entire ﬁ le. Record updating is much faster with random access ﬁ les because you must rewrite \n",
      "only the record that has been changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bad news about random access ﬁ les is that you must design the record size in terms of a \n",
      "worst-case scenario. Even though you know that most peoples’ ﬁ rst names do not exceed 10 char-\n",
      "acters, you might need to design the number of bytes devoted to the customer’s ﬁ rst name to be \n",
      "15 bytes because of that one oddball whose parents thought it would be cute to name their son \n",
      "Guyfromtazmania. The same is true for all the information in the record. Street addresses, city \n",
      "names, e-mail addresses, and so on all must be designed for the largest possible size. Obviously, the \n",
      "trick to designing the byte size for each piece of string data is a balancing act between wasting bytes \n",
      "and recording the requisite information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this worst-case design philosophy, random access ﬁ les are not dense like sequential ﬁ les. \n",
      "If a customer has a short name and lives at an address like 1 Elm St., and has no e-mail address, that \n",
      "customer might use 100 bytes of the 300 bytes you’ve allowed for him in his record in the ﬁ le. This \n",
      "means there are information “gaps” in the ﬁ le where no data are stored. Such a random access ﬁ le \n",

      "\n",
      "A database table is constructed of data arranged in rows and columns. Each row in a database table \n",

      "or more rows. If the table has zero rows, the database table is said to be empty and contains no use-\n",
      "ful information. Database tables almost always have at least two or more ﬁ elds in them.\n",

      "You can think of a database ﬁ eld as being similar to a property for a class. Each ﬁ eld is used to \n",
      "store values for a particular data item. For example, in Chapter 13 your electronic phone book \n",
      "program had properties for your friend’s ﬁ rst name, middle initial, last name, addresses, city, \n",
      "state, ZIP code, and so on. Each of these properties could be used to construct a ﬁ eld in a data-\n",
      "base table. It follows, then, that each row in the database table would become a record for one \n",
      "of your friends in the phone book database. It should also be clear that each row in a table must \n",
      "have at least one ﬁ eld that is different than other rows in the table. If that were not the case, you \n",

      "could be verbalized as “inherits from.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of inheritance is built upon the notion that many objects share similar properties. In the \n",
      "preceding statement, you state that you want to create a new class named frmMain that inherits all \n",
      "the functionality of a basic Windows form. Inheriting this functionality means that you don’t need \n",
      "to write, test, debug, and maintain that inherited code. Therefore, the driving force behind inheri-\n",
      "tance is to simplify writing code. Inheritance makes it possible for your code to extend one class to \n",
      "suit your speciﬁ c needs. Simply stated, inheritance is the ability to take one class and extend that \n",
      "class to suit a similar, albeit different, purpose. An example can help explain inheritance.\n",

      "private (-) access speciﬁ ers you learned in Chapter 9, a new access speciﬁ er (#) is used. \n",
      "The sharp sign (#) denotes the protected access speciﬁ er. The protected access speciﬁ er is \n",
      "needed because of the symbiotic relationship ( “is a”) formed between the base class and the \n",

      "\n",
      "To understand why the protected class is used, consider how things would work if you were lim-\n",
      "ited to either a public or a private access speciﬁ er. First, consider the private access speciﬁ er. If \n",
      "you use the private access speciﬁ er in clsBuilding, each method and property in clsBuilding\n",
      "has class scope. As you already know, this means that those properties and methods would not be \n",
      "visible outside the class. Stated another way, any private property or method in clsBuilding would \n",
      "not be available to any outside class, including the three derived classes. Therefore, nothing in the \n",
      "program would have access to the base properties and methods. If you can’t access them, they are \n",
      "virtually worthless to the derived classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now consider the other alternative: making all the properties and methods public. If you did that, \n",
      "you just threw away all the beneﬁ ts that encapsulation brings to the party. Not only can the derived \n",
      "classes gain access to the properties and methods of the base class, but so can every other object in \n",

      "\n",
      "Using either the public or private access speciﬁ er poses a dilemma: two choices, both bad. The \n",

      "\n",
      "The keyword base is used here to pass parameters used to construct the clsApartment object on \n",

      "Base Classes Are Not Derived Classes\n",
      "\n",
      "The capability for a derived class to use a method in the base class is a one-way relationship. That is, \n",
      "the derived class can call a base class method, but the base class cannot directly call a derived class \n",
      "method. For example, suppose clsCommercial contains a public method named HouseCleaning().\n",

      "This conclusion is true even if you use the public access speciﬁ er for the HouseCleaning() method. \n",
      "The reason you can’t perform a base-to-derived method call is that the “is a” relationship shown \n",
      "in Figure 16-1 is a one-way street. That is, a clsCommercial object assumes all the property and \n",

      "that instantiating an object of the base class doesn’t make sense. For example, you might create a \n",
      "tree class called clsDeciduous that has the properties leafColor, barkStyle, matureHeight, and \n",
      "ringCount. The derived classes might be clsOak, clsMaple, clsWillow and so on. The problem is \n",
      "that even though all the derived classes have leaves, bark, a mature height, and a ring count, there \n",

      "\n",
      "public virtual string RemoveSnow()\n",
      "{\n",
      "   return whichType[buildingType] +\n",
      "          \": No snow removal service available.\";\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "The virtual Keyword\n",
      "\n",
      "The snow removal method in clsBuilding, RemoveSnow(), is deﬁ ned via the keyword virtual. The \n",
      "word virtual is used to identify that the method may be overridden in a derived class. Stated differently, \n",
      "a virtual method can be replaced by a different deﬁ nition of the method in any class derived from this \n",
      "base class.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you refer to Figure 16-1, you can see that you provide RemoveSnow() methods for both clsApart-\n",

      "were informed when they signed their lease that they were responsible for snow removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The override Keyword\n",
      "\n",
      "As you might guess, the override keyword goes hand in hand with the virtual keyword. Whereas \n",
      "virtual tells the reader of the code that the method may be overridden, the override keyword tells \n",
      "her that this method is overriding a method found in the class from which it inherits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, the derived class overrides a virtual method deﬁ ned in the base class. However, you can \n",
      "deﬁ ne a new class from a derived class. For example, you could add clsRecreational to clsHome,\n",
      "perhaps with new properties for lakeFrontage, boatRamp, availableFishingTackle, and so on. The \n",
      "deﬁ nition of that class might be as follows:\n",

      " {\n",
      "     // Class code\n",

      "You can keep extending the class deﬁ nitions as far as you think you need them. (If you want to prevent \n",
      "further inheritance from a class, you can use the sealed keyword as a modiﬁ er in the class deﬁ nition, \n",
      "as in public sealed clsLastClass. Using the sealed keyword means that further derivations from \n",
      "this class are not permitted.)\n",

      "}\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Note that clsHome doesn’t even have a RemoveSnow() method, yet it still displays the following \n",
      "message:\n",
      "\n",
      "Home: No snow removal service available.\n",
      "\n",

      "e.Argument) into another type of object (for example, clsPrint). In the code, this changes the event \n",

      "\n",
      "You may be thinking, “Why not just use the editor's search-and-replace functionality?” The reason \n",

      "a variable named flag deﬁ ned in one statement block and another variable with the same name in \n",
      "a different statement block, Refactoring changes only the occurrences of flag that have the same \n",

      "number to factorial. Because factorials can produce large numbers, one problem is using an int data \n",

      "better to use a double to extend its range. \n",
      "\n",
      "A second, and more subtle problem, is that the test expression, i > 0, causes the loop to execute \n",

      "Clearly this is a problem that begs for an inherited solution. The base class would be called clsMem-\n",
